cs311 HW Programs

  These files must be used to write your HW programs!!
  ** Work within these directories!! **

  Always read @@read-me before you begin. 

  Always complete all ** parts
  Always make sure all necessary files are #included
  Note that to use exit(1), you must include <stdlib.h> 

  .out files are my programs that you can run before you write
   your own.

TO COMPILE:
g++ <list cpp files only>   
Never never compile .h files.

If you have only one HW per directory, you can simply do
g++ *.cpp 

TO RUN:
./a.out

TO RECORD TEST RESULTS:
/cs/recordhw <put a brand new .txt file name here e.g. Test.txt>

compile here
run here

exit

Download the created file.
