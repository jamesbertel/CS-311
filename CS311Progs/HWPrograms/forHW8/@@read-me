HW8 INSTRUCTIONS

Read the assignment sheet thoroughly.

Study the example hw8output.txt for 
the table format example.

This HW shows how easy it is to change el_t
to have multiple parts in it.  
We need to define el_t in elem.h and elem.cpp to do this.
PLEASE STUDY the files very carefully!!!!!

Copy your llist and slist files here and
update them first:
 cp ../forHW7/llist.* . 
 cp ../forHW7/slist.* . 
1) el_t is now a class so remove typedef but
   #include elem.h
2) copy search as search2 and update search2 so
   that it returns the found element
   itself (el_t) and not the position 
   (if not found, returns a completely blank el_t)

Complete htable.cpp and hw8client.cpp including good comments.
