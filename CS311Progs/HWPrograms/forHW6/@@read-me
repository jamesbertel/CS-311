HW6 INSTRUCTIONS:

Read the assignment sheet thoroughly.

Copy all the linked list files here first (llist and slist).
cp  ../forHW3/llist* .
cp  ../forHW3/slist* .

First test your slist/llist throughly
using slistTest files.
If it does not work, you cannot work on HW6 yet.

PLEASE DO NOT remove couts in llist and slist constructors and
destructors yet!!! 

Then, llist typdef should be changed to char to allow vertex names.

hw6.out shows the correct output but 
do not to do control-C to end the program
and make the table look nicer.
